                                <h5>Mildred Abbatiello</h5>
                                <p>Mildred had an unusual obsession with bubble wrap and found immense joy in popping
                                    the tiny air-filled bubbles. One fateful day, she received an oversized package
                                    containing an entire roll of industrial-grade bubble wrap. Overcome with excitement,
                                    Mildred decided to indulge in the ultimate popping experience by wrapping herself
                                    from head to toe in the bubble wrap. As she gleefully rolled around on the floor,
                                    reveling in the satisfying sound of each bubble bursting, she failed to notice the
                                    increasing tightness of the wrap around her body. Eventually, Mildred became
                                    completely enveloped in a cocoon of bubble wrap, unable to free herself and
                                    tragically suffocating amidst her beloved popping paradise.

                                <p>Geraldine was a dedicated yoga practitioner who took her practice to extreme lengths.
                                    One morning, during her routine sun salutations on her apartment balcony, Geraldine
                                    attempted a particularly ambitious pose that involved balancing on one leg while
                                    holding a potted plant above her head. In her quest for perfect alignment, she lost
                                    her balance and toppled over the railing, landing in the neighbor's inflatable
                                    swimming pool. Despite the soft landing, Geraldine's demise was attributed to the
                                    shock of finding herself suddenly surrounded by floating flamingo pool toys.</p>

                                    in his suburban backyard. One sunny afternoon, he decided to up the ante by juggling
                                    various household items while simultaneously mowing the lawn. As he deftly tossed a
                                    set of steak knives into the air, Barry failed to notice the garden gnome hidden in
                                    the tall grass. In a comedic twist of fate, the lawnmower snagged the gnome and
                                    launched it into the air, striking Barry squarely on the head and rendering him
                                    unconscious. His neighbors later discovered him sprawled out on the lawn surrounded
                                    by rogue garden ornaments, a cautionary tale of the perils of multitasking gone
                                    awry.</p>

                                    Fed up, Geraldine sought revenge with a potion from Aunt Mildred, aiming for poetic
                                    justice. But when Mildred mistakenly added catnip instead of the intended herb,
                                    Frank's antics took a wild turn. He started purring, chasing imaginary mice, and
                                    ended up being mistaken for a lion by a passing the police and got killed.</p>
